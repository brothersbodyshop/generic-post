might have to change post and social names i dont think that you can have - in the import names!
setup the conf file to pull in all social data
use exception example from ooyala app



split the generic-social out of the generic-post though the sitepost.model need importing
for it to work (get_full_path method)



documentation:
    start writing up the dependencies for the apps!
    general use
